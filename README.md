# Active-Directory-User-Info-Extractor
This Python script automates the process of retrieving detailed user account information from an Active Directory (AD) domain using the net user /domain command. It processes a list of usernames, gathers relevant information (such as full name, password set/expiry times, last logon, etc.), and saves the results to an Excel spreadsheet.
